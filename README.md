# This is tasky.

This is a task manager that you can use to plan your cases and organize activities


## What's this?

* Add your tasks
* Indicate the place and time 
* do not be late!

## How is it done?

The application is based on ะก++/Qt in conjunction with the SQLite3 database. Because of this, there is a high chance of unauthorized access. My bad :(.

## How do I get this running/working with this?

The repository contains an assembly for Windows, and also the "sourse_code" folder contains all the sources. Have fun!

## What's next?

* Adding edit entries
* Adding a convenient context menu
* Improving work with the database and its protection
* Application authorization
